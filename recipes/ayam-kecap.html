        <h1>Ayam Kecap</h1>
        <img src="../img/ayam-kecap.jpeg"
        <p>This is a staple dish in Indonesia that every home knows how to cook. It requires a little bit of a niche ingredient which is Kecap Manis (sweet soy sauce) but it's a super versatile and delicious sauce to keep at home! It should be easy to find in Asian grocery stores but if you canâ€™t find it, 3 parts honey to 1 part soy sauce will make a great substitute in a pinch. This dish only takes about half an hour to make and is a punch of sticky, savoury goodness. Substitute the meat however you want and replace it with tofu and omit the oyster sauce to make it vegan! Try this for a protein-rich taste of South East Asia!
