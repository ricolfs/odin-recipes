    <h1>Scallop Pasta</h1>
    <img src="../img/scallop-pasta-img.jpeg" width="75"/>

    <p>This is a super easy dish that takes 20 minutes and is rich in vitamin B12 and omega-3-fatty acids and will help you fulfill the Canada Food Guideâ€™s recommended 2 servings of fish per week! It's a dish packed with umami and is sure to impress! To increase your fiber intake, you could use whole wheat pasta instead! To make it vegan, you could also omit the seafood and instead replace it with tofu. This is definitely worth trying if you are a seafood or pasta enthusiast!
