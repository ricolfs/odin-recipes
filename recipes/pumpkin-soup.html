        <p>The beauty of pumpkin soup - and this classic pumpkin soup recipe in particular - is that it’s so versatile and forgiving. It’s one of the easiest meals to make with just a handful of ingredients, and it’s almost impossible to mess up. The author, Valli Little, originally created this recipe way back in 2004 and it was passed on to us here at taste as one of the first pumpkin soup recipes we ever published online. Since then, it’s become one of the most popular pumpkin soup recipes in Australia, with more than 350 rave reviews to date. What makes it so special? It’s creamy without being heavy, delicately spiced without being spicy, and hearty without being too rich. Pretty much everything we look for in a pumpkin soup (and we’ve tried a lot of pumpkin soup recipes over the years!). To get the most out of this pumpkin soup, ensure you soften the onion and leek until they just start to release some of their juices and flavours, but don’t go so far as to let them caramelise. This gives the soup a subtle sweetness of flavour without any risk of bitterness.
